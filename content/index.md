### Setup Development Env

The mobile app solution is a HTML5 based solution.

- **React & Redux** are two major frameworks used to build the user interface.
- **NodeJS and npm** are used to develop the app.

Before starting the development, you need to setup the development enviorement first. Please go to setup page ([SETUP](./setup.html)) to setup the enviorement.

### IDE
The solution does not rely on any specific IDE. How ever we recommend VS Code or WebStorm(need license).
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial) or [WebStorm](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2015/10/working-with-reactjs-in-webstorm-coding-assistance/) 
  - Atom and Sublime are workable as well

To tune the page through Chrome, you need to install the Chrome and according Chrome plugin.
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Redux Chrome plugin ([google app store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en))

### Naming conventions
1. All varialbes, parameters, properties, functions and files names should follow Camel Case
2. All class names and react component js file names should follow Pascal Case
3. All const strings should follow UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNSERSCORE
4. All naming should be self-descriptive, more detail would be better.
